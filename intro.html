       You stayed late after school for soccer practice. It was getting dark, so you took a shortcut to get home faster.

        As you walked, you heard leaves crunch behind you. A car passed slowly but kept going, so you ignored it.
        
        Then, the car stopped.
        
        A man got out and called, "Hey, can you help me?"
        
        You hesitated. He looked kinda creepy, but he was old. He probably needed help.
        
        You walked around the truck toward him.
        
        Before you could react—something hit you in the head.
        
        Everything went black.
