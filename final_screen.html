        You step outside, the cold night air biting at your skin as sirens wail in the distance. 
        The police rush in, their voices sharp and commands clear. Moments later, they drag out John Bill in handcuffs. 
        He doesn’t resist, staring ahead with an empty expression.
        Inside, officers make more horrifying discoveries. Cut-up body parts scattered through the house, bones buried in the basement. 
        There are no other survivors. 
        The victims who came before you were not just killed; some were fed to his dog.
        The remains of those identified are returned to their families. Others will never be named.
        Days later, the trial moves quickly. Life in prison with no parole. 
        The world learns his name, calling him the Butcher of Hollow Creek.
        People call it justice. You try to believe it, but nothing can erase what you endured. The images, the sounds, the smell of that house linger.
        John Bill is gone, but the nightmares remain. THE END!
