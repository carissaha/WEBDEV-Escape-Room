           "Three doors stand before your eyes, where secrets hide and danger lies.
           One leads forward, the other two deceive, but only the wise may take their leave.
           The left one creaks, the middle sighs, the rightmost door just watchesâ€”wise.
           Choose the path where silence stays, and find the end of haunted days."
